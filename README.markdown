# Comments

Simple comment system that you can host yourself using PHP and MySql.

Simply add something like the following 2 lines to any static html page.

    <div id="comments"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://silentorbit.com/comments/inc/1/script.js"><script>

To also support when javascript is disabled use add the following code:

    <noscript>
        <object data="http://silentorbit.com/comments/inc/1/ref.html" width="600" height="500" />
    </noscript>

For this to work you must have registered your site and be given a site id(sid) as seen being used in the code.
This makes it possible for you as the site owner to allow anonymous comments and delete comments of others.
